// Grading config. Each entry says how to check one widget.
//
// Plain query widgets: `expected` points at a fixture of the exact rows the
// reference solution returns (order matters -- the widget's ORDER BY is
// part of the spec).
//
// Action widgets: the widget itself is run once (with `params` if it takes
// any), then one or more `verify` queries check the resulting DB state
// against fixtures.
//
// `paramsQuery` (instead of `params`): a SELECT run fresh against whatever
// data is actually loaded, whose first row's columns become the params --
// use this instead of a hardcoded literal ID whenever the widget needs a
// REAL row to exist (a real customer, a real non-delivered order, ...).
// A literal ID only ever matches one specific dataset; a paramsQuery works
// against the small sample, the real ~99k dataset, or anything else. Any
// `:paramName` token in a `verify` entry's SQL gets substituted with the
// SAME resolved value the widget itself was called with.
//
// week08 widgets are run per role/param `case` -- same widget, different
// session, checked against a per-case fixture.
//
// Listed in week order -- this is also the order results render in on the
// dashboard's "Run full check" panel.
